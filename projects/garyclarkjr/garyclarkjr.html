            Gary Clark Jr. (born February 15, 1984) is an American musician from Austin, Texas. Dubbed <strong style="color: rgba(28, 86, 211, 0.616)" >'The Chosen One'</strong>, Clark has shared the stage with many legends of rock and roll, including Eric Clapton, B. B. King and the Rolling Stones. He is best known for his fusion of blues, rock and soul music with elements of hip hop.

            Gary Clark Jr. began playing guitar at the age of twelve. Born and raised in Austin, Texas, Clark played small gigs throughout his teens, until he met promoter Clifford Antone, proprietor of the Austin music club Antone's. Antone's was the launch pad from which Jimmie and Stevie Ray Vaughan redefined blues at the time. Soon after meeting Clifford, Clark began to play with an array of musical icons, including Jimmie Vaughan. Vaughan and others in the Austin music community helped Clark along his musical path, facilitating his ascent in the Texas rock and roll scene. Clark's music demonstrates how the blues have shaped virtually every medium of music over the past century, from hip-hop to country.
